# Bookmark Collection

A simple PHP site that stores bookmarks in an SQLite database.
Sections group related bookmarks and each entry can be added, edited, or removed.

## Usage
Start a local PHP server:

```
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000/index.php](http://localhost:8000/index.php) in your browser.
The database file `bookmarks.sqlite` will be created automatically in this directory.
